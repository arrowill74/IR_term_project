The perpetrators have not yet been caught.\nIn the wake of Gatwick's drone disruption, UK airports including Heathrow and Gatwick invested millions of pounds in anti-drone technology, according to British media reports.\nOn Monday, the UK's Department for Transport said the government was moving forward with plans to give police new powers to \"tackle drones' misuse and abuse.\" Under new legislation, police will be given additional powers to land, seize and search drones. Exclusion zones around airports where drones are banned from flying will be extended and drone operators will be required by law to register beginning in November 2019.\nHeathrow is currently the world's seventh-busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers, with 78 million in 2017."}
